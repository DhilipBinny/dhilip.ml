            The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <span style='color: rgba(211, 9, 9, 0.863)'><i>network of networks</i></span> that consists millions of of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.

            The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to the "the ARPA internet". <span style ='color: red'>The interconnection of regional acedemic networks in the 1980s mark the beginning of the transition to the modern internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mmobile computers were connected to it.
